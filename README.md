# WallPaperSorter
Easy python wallpaper sorter.

- Runs in a folder with wallpapers.
- Creates a folder called "sorted". With subfolders <aspect ratio>/<resolution>
- Moving all image files from the current folder in to those folders.

- If the image size or aspect ratio is unrecognized, it creates a folder "unsort"

I'm using Python 3.5.0 under Windows (64bit).
